# Classify the categories of documents.

Your job is to write a machine learning code to classify documents using 
naive bayes algorithm.

## Write a function `q05_classifier` that 
- Makes use of input data from `q01_load_data` question.
- Makes use of input data from `q04_count_vectors` question.
- Fits the tokenized training data with naive bayes model and predicts in which category the
document lies in.



### Parameters:

| Parameter | dtype | argument type | default value | description |

| path | String | compulsory |  | Path of data folder |




### Returns:

| Return | dtype | description |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| variable1 | numpy.ndarray | predicted categories |
| variable2 | float | accuracy of model |
